What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you as a learner during WDI?

    I have developed a habit of working on my own for assignments. Along with this, I haven’t not been required to do deadline specific homework for a while. I don’t believe I will have much of a problem with group work but I am concerned about meeting deadlines for the homework assignments, not because of the time but because the amount of work.

How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?

    I can minimize those concerns by planning ahead, staying a few additional hours at GA to get ahead and setting smaller deadlines for myself.

What learning tactics or approaches do you feel have most benefitted you as a student?

    I work very well when I outline my objectives, the tools, and content that I will need to execute each task.

Can you think of any strategies to increase the output or viability of these approaches in the context of WDI? (No idea is too crazy.)

    One idea is to have a kind of interactive reminder page that prompts me to consider my resoures when working on assignments. It could also help in time management and help in working more efficiently in increments, as well as reviewing concepts covered in class.

Finally, list two learning experiences from your life which at first gave you trouble but you overcame through perserverence.

    learning how to dance
    learning neuroscience
