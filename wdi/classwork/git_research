Git research
    What is Git?
        Answer: Git is a control system that is useful for keeping a precise history of one's work through version-tracking.
        Unlike other programs, Gits does not simply save the history of the file, it records every change that is saved as
        little snapshots. This leaves little room for lost data, and allows people to work offline until they can connect to the
        internet.

    What problem does it solve?
        Answer: It reduces clutter and confusion when needing to search for different versions of a document, it offers
        offers more extensive storage of this data and it is also useful for data recovery concerns.

    What are the alternatives to Git?
        Answer: As an alternative to Git are other programs, like CVCS, but these programs save the file in different forms.
        Grit however records every change that is made and saved or committed.This offers an incredible amount of detail
        into the history.

    Articulate a specific scenario in which Git would be useful.
        Scenario: I was working on a document for homework and I worked with a code, saved (or comitted it) it so that I
        could try to run it. Once I get to class however, I add something onto my code and that ruins everything. I can
        use git to get back to the working version of my document
