CONCEPTS
      Data types                                classifies data, determines what operations can be done
      Data structure                          way of organizing data, so that computers can use it efficiently - get it back, keep it organized
      Arrays  []                                  list - Indexed by number. Order starts with 0 & separated by comma
                                                      ex. breakfast_foods = [water, rice, sushi]
                                                      student.keys ---> will give you an array
                                                      Can push things into it -> breakfast_foods.push ("tea","water")
                                                      breakfast_food.unshift("vitamins")    -you unshift to put string in front of list
                                                      Can use any kind of data type
      Hashes  {}                               Key-value pairs (like variables, it points to something else)
                                                      like a dictionary - you put something in and get it right back out
                                                      {"name"=> "Dennis"} bus [2] - hey bus, give me what is inside of number 2
                                                          (key            value)

                                                      defining or creating a hash  student={name}

                                                      hash assignments            hash["key"] = value
                                                      dances.pop - remove last thing
                                                      dances.push  -  add to end
                                                      dances_move = dances.shift

                                                      student["keys"]= "key2"
                                                      .class
symbols                                           Declare them once and it always references the same string
                                                        light weight strings, immutable

                                                                                array.delete @(index#)

                                                        Order
                                                              array.index(value)

                                                              array[origin]:"american"

                                                            Arrays are ordered, hashes are
                                                            Hash - anything can be a key, for an array, only ordered by number

What different methods can you use to access or read values from an array
array[1] --> returns ["y"]
array.first --> returns ["x"]
array.last --> returns ["xx"]
array.take(2) --> returns the first 2, ["x, "y"]
array.drop(2) --> returns the last 2, ["z", "xx"]

array.index("value")
array.each do

array.sample

What different methods are available to remove or destroy values?
  array.pop --> removes a value from the back
  array.shift --> removes a value from the front
  array.delete(2) --> removes the value at index(2): "z"
  array.compact --> removes all 'nil' values from the array (remember to add '!' if you want this specific one to be modified)
  array.uniq --> removes duplicates
